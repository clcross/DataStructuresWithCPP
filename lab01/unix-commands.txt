Enter your chosen Unix environment.  For the word 'command' assume it is a one line command unless explicitly stated otherwise.  

*******************************************************************************
*********State what command(s) you used to accomplish each task.***************
*******************************************************************************

1. What unix-based OS you are using (Ubuntu, Fedora, OSX, etc...)?
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:~ cameroncross$ uname -a
Darwin Camerons-MacBook-Pro.local 18.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.7.0: Thu Jun 20 18:42:21 PDT 2019; root:xnu-4903.270.47~4/RELEASE_X86_64 x86_64

2. What are command line options (also called parameters)?
They are commands or phrases that are used to interact with a computer using terminal.

3. What are ALL the files in your home directory (the directory you start in) whose name contains the word 'bash'?  What command did you use?
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:~ cameroncross$ ls -a
.bash_history
.bash_sessions

4. Create a new directory in your home and call it lab01.
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:~ cameroncross$ mkdir lab01

5. Create a directory inside of lab01 named lab01_sub while still in the home directory.
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:~ cameroncross$ mkdir lab01/lab01_sub

6. Create a file inside lab01_sub named readme-please.txt, the file can be empty
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:lab01_sub cameroncross$ touch readme-please.txt

7. What is the full (absolute) path of lab01_sub? What command did you use?
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:lab01_sub cameroncross$ pwd
/Users/cameroncross/lab01/lab01_sub

8. If your present working directory is lab01, name three 1 line commands that will return you to your home directory?
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:lab01 cameroncross$ cd ..
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:lab01 cameroncross$ cd ~
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:lab01 cameroncross$ cd

9. Copy the readme-please.txt (that is in the current working directory) file into your home directory (not the directory named home, the top level directory of your personal files)
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:lab01_sub cameroncross$ cp readme-please.txt ~

10. Rename this new file to be completely-useless.txt
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:~ cameroncross$ mv readme-please.txt completely-useless.txt

11. Explain what |, <, >, and >> do when used on the command prompt.
| acts as a divider do that one command is ran then the other.
< is used to send items through a network.
> is used to input text to a file and create it if it does not exist.
>> does a similar job to > but it does not overwite the text that is currently in the file.

12. What is the difference between * and ? in filename wildcards?
* will find any number of characters before or after the input depending where it was placed while ? only finds the place where it was put.

13. What command would you type in order to determine the number of lines in somefile.txt that do NOT contain HI hi Hi or hI?  Hint, grep is your friend.
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:~ cameroncross$ grep -vci 'hi' somefile.txt

14. What 1 line command would you type to generate a file names.txt that contains a list of users currently on the system sorted lexicographically (default order of sort) (hint: who is on the system)?
Camerons-MacBook-Pro:Users cameroncross$ sudo cut -d: -f1 /Users | sort | cat> names.txt

15. What does the -r option do for the rm command?  How about -f?  Hint: use man.
-r lets you remove a folder with files still inside it.
-f Attempt to remove the files without prompting for confirmation, regardless of the file's permissions.  If the file does
   not exist, do not display a diagnostic message or modify the

16. Is executing the command 'rm -rf *' from your home directory a good idea?  Why/why not (what would it do)?
because the -rf will remove folders and files without permission and the * will target all items in the directory.
